# CAT
WIP port of AT in c++.

Currently works, however it has ~~extremely~~ limited functionality.

CAT stands for C++ Algorithmic Trader.


Meant to be a much faster version of AT.
Edit: This C++ version is so much faster than the python version. There's a difference of night and day when comparing speeds.
